# Confirm box before deleting a row in a Table

I created this snippet to be able to confirm before a delete, directly from a table with multiple rows.
Instead of running a modal window, I wanted to overridde the content of the `<tr>` with the confirm box content.

The snippet is not complete, which means that you can use it with whatever language you are using.
However the JavaScript is written with jQuery.
